# AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware

Starlite exports a class called [`AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware`][starlite.middleware.AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware],
which is an Abstract Base Class (ABC) that implements the [`MiddlewareProtocol`](../7-middleware/creating-middleware/#using-middlewareprotocol).
To add authentication to your app using this class as a basis, subclass it and implement the abstract method
[`authenticate_request`][starlite.middleware.authentication.AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware.authenticate_request]:

```python
from starlite import (
    AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware,
    AuthenticationResult,
    ASGIConnection,
)


class MyAuthenticationMiddleware(AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware):
    async def authenticate_request(
        self, connection: ASGIConnection
    ) -> AuthenticationResult:
        # do something here.
        ...
```

As you can see, `authenticate_request` is an async function that receives a connection instance and is supposed to return
an [`AuthenticationResult`][starlite.middleware.AuthenticationResult] instance, which is a pydantic model that has two attributes:

1. `user`: a non-optional value representing a user. It's typed as `Any` so it receives any value, including `None`.
2. `auth`: an optional value representing the authentication scheme. Defaults to `None`.

These values are then set as part of the "scope" dictionary, and they are made available as `Request.user`
and `Request.auth` respectively, for HTTP route handlers, and `WebSocket.user` and `WebSocket.auth` for websocket route
handlers.

## Example: Implementing a JWTAuthenticationMiddleware

Since the above is quite hard to grasp in the abstract, lets see an example.

We start off by creating a user model. It can be implemented using pydantic, and ODM, ORM etc. For the sake of the
example here lets say it's a pydantic model:

```python title="my_app/db/models.py"
import uuid

from sqlalchemy import Column
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import UUID
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()


class User(Base):
    id: uuid.UUID | None = Column(
        UUID(as_uuid=True), default=uuid.uuid4, primary_key=True
    )
    # ... other fields follow, but we only require id for this example
```

We will also need some utility methods to encode and decode tokens. To this end we will use
the [python-jose](https://github.com/mpdavis/python-jose) library. We will also create a pydantic model representing a
JWT Token:

```python title="my_app/security/jwt.py"
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from uuid import UUID

from jose import JWTError, jwt
from pydantic import BaseModel, UUID4
from starlite.exceptions import NotAuthorizedException

from app.config import settings

DEFAULT_TIME_DELTA = timedelta(days=1)
ALGORITHM = "HS256"


class Token(BaseModel):
    exp: datetime
    iat: datetime
    sub: UUID4


def decode_jwt_token(encoded_token: str) -> Token:
    """
    Helper function that decodes a jwt token and returns the value stored under the 'sub' key

    If the token is invalid or expired (i.e. the value stored under the exp key is in the past) an exception is raised
    """
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token=encoded_token, key=settings.JWT_SECRET, algorithms=[ALGORITHM])
        return Token(**payload)
    except JWTError as e:
        raise NotAuthorizedException("Invalid token") from e


def encode_jwt_token(user_id: UUID, expiration: timedelta = DEFAULT_TIME_DELTA) -> str:
    """Helper function that encodes a JWT token with expiration and a given user_id"""
    token = Token(
        exp=datetime.now() + expiration,
        iat=datetime.now(),
        sub=user_id,
    )
    return jwt.encode(token.dict(), settings.JWT_SECRET, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
```

We can now create our authentication middleware:

```python title="my_app/security/authentication_middleware.py"
from typing import cast, TYPE_CHECKING

from sqlalchemy import select
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from starlite import (
    AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware,
    AuthenticationResult,
    NotAuthorizedException,
    ASGIConnection,
)

from app.db.models import User
from app.security.jwt import decode_jwt_token

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncEngine

API_KEY_HEADER = "X-API-KEY"


class JWTAuthenticationMiddleware(AbstractAuthenticationMiddleware):
    async def authenticate_request(
            self, connection: ASGIConnection
    ) -> AuthenticationResult:
        """
        Given a request, parse the request api key stored in the header and retrieve the user correlating to the token from the DB

        """

        # retrieve the auth header
        auth_header = connection.headers.get(API_KEY_HEADER)
        if not auth_header:
            raise NotAuthorizedException()

        # decode the token, the result is a 'Token' model instance
        token = decode_jwt_token(encoded_token=auth_header)

        engine = cast("AsyncEngine", connection.app.state.postgres_connection)
        async with AsyncSession(engine) as async_session:
            async with async_session.begin():
                user = await async_session.execute(
                    select(User).where(User.id == token.sub)
                )
        if not user:
            raise NotAuthorizedException()
        return AuthenticationResult(user=user, auth=token)
```

Finally, we need to pass our middleware to the Starlite constructor:

```python title="my_app/main.py"
from starlite import Starlite
from starlite.middleware.base import DefineMiddleware

from my_app.security.authentication_middleware import JWTAuthenticationMiddleware
# you can optionally exclude certain paths from authentication.
# the following excludes all routes mounted at or under `/schema*`
auth_mw = DefineMiddleware(JWTAuthenticationMiddleware, exclude="schema")

app = Starlite(request_handlers=[...], middleware=[auth_mw])
```

That's it. The `JWTAuthenticationMiddleware` will now run for every request, and we would be able to access these in a
http route handler in the following way:

```python
from starlite import Request, get

from my_app.db.models import User
from my_app.security.jwt import Token


@get("/")
def my_route_handler(request: Request[User, Token]) -> None:
    user = request.user  # correctly typed as User
    auth = request.auth  # correctly typed as Token
    assert isinstance(user, User)
    assert isinstance(auth, Token)
```

Or for a websocket route:

```python
from starlite import WebSocket, websocket

from my_app.db.models import User
from my_app.security.jwt import Token


@websocket("/")
async def my_route_handler(socket: WebSocket[User, Token]) -> None:
    user = socket.user  # correctly typed as User
    auth = socket.auth  # correctly typed as Token
    assert isinstance(user, User)
    assert isinstance(auth, Token)
```

And if you'd like to exclude individual routes outside those configured:

```python
import anyio
from starlite import Starlite, MediaType, NotFoundException, Response, get
from starlite.middleware.base import DefineMiddleware

from my_app.security.authentication_middleware import JWTAuthenticationMiddleware

# you can optionally exclude certain paths from authentication.
# the following excludes all routes mounted at or under `/schema*`
# additionally,
# you can modify the default exclude key of "exclude_from_auth", by overriding the `exclude_from_auth_key` parameter on the Authentication Middleware
auth_mw = DefineMiddleware(JWTAuthenticationMiddleware, exclude="schema")


@get(path="/", exclude_from_auth=True)
async def site_index() -> Response:
    """Site index"""
    exists = await anyio.Path("index.html").exists()
    if exists:
        async with await anyio.open_file(anyio.Path("index.html")) as file:
            content = await file.read()
            return Response(content=content, status_code=200, media_type=MediaType.HTML)
    raise NotFoundException("Site index was not found")


app = Starlite(route_handlers=[site_index], middleware=[auth_mw])
```

And of course use the same kind of mechanism for dependencies:

```python
from typing import Any

from starlite import Request, Provide, Router

from my_app.db.models import User
from my_app.security.jwt import Token


async def my_dependency(request: Request[User, Token]) -> Any:
    user = request.user  # correctly typed as User
    auth = request.auth  # correctly typed as Token
    assert isinstance(user, User)
    assert isinstance(auth, Token)


my_router = Router(
    path="sub-path/", dependencies={"some_dependency": Provide(my_dependency)}
)
```
